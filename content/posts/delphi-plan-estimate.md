## Project Planning and Estimation for the Delphi Evaluation Tool

In this phase of the project, we will focus on planning and estimating the work required to build the Delphi Evaluation Tool. This involves defining user stories, estimating their complexity, and creating a roadmap for development.

## 1. Define User Stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability. They typically follow the format:

```
As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].
```

For example:

```
As an expert user, I want to create a survey so that I can gather opinions from other experts.
```

## 2. Estimate User Stories

Once we have defined our user stories, we need to estimate the effort required to implement each one. This can be done using various estimation techniques such as story points, t-shirt sizes, or ideal hours. For simplicity, we will use story points, which are a relative measure of the complexity of a user story.

## 3. Commit User Stories to Sprint

After estimating the user stories, we will prioritize them and commit to a set of stories for the upcoming sprint. This will help us focus on delivering value incrementally and allow for adjustments based on feedback.

## 4. Create Tasks for User Stories

Each user story can be broken down into smaller tasks that are more manageable and easier to estimate. For example, the user story about creating a survey might include tasks such as designing the survey form, implementing the backend logic, and testing the functionality.

## 5. Estimate Tasks

Similar to user stories, we will estimate the effort required for each task. This will help us understand the workload for the sprint and ensure that we can deliver the committed user stories within the sprint timeframe.

## 6. Update Sprint Backlog

As we progress through the sprint, we will continuously update the sprint backlog to reflect the current status of tasks and user stories. This will help us track our progress and make any necessary adjustments to ensure we meet our sprint goals.
