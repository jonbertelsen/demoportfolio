## Delphi Evaluation tool

A web-based tool that facilitates the Delphi method for group decision-making and forecasting. Users can create surveys, invite experts, and aggregate responses over multiple rounds to reach a consensus.

Originally the Delphi method is done with paper and pen, this tool would streamline the process and provide analytics on the results. The ideas came from the Rand Coorporation who developed the method in the 1950s.

My aim is to build a version of this tool using modern web technologies, focusing on usability and data visualization. Also, I want to explore how AI can assist in summarizing expert opinions and suggesting consensus points.
